git add <filename> 
git add  .            bundles the collection of files on which changes are made

git commit -m "<meaningful commit message>"   describe the change(s)  you have made in your project at the time of that commit

git remote add origin <remote repo link>   adds your github/target repository link to a variable called origin so that variable can be used instead of URL
